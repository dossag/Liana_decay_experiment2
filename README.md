# Liana and tree wood decomposition
Wood decomposition is important to redistribute nutrient within ecosystems. But most of our knowledge of this process is based on empirical research on one plant growth form. In tropical and subtropical forests, the contribution of lianas another important plant growth form may also be important to forest carbon and nutrient dynamics. Lianas usually have high stem turnover rates and may produce softer wood with a distinct chemical profile that may decay more rapidly than trees. Although, numerous studies have examined chemical profile of tree and liana leaves, to date, however, the chemical profile and afterlife and decomposition dynamics of lianas remained unknown. In this experiment, we attempt to fill this gap by directly contrasting wood decomposition of 12 liana and 12 tree species in a tropical forest in China. We hypothesized that: 1) liana wood decomposes faster than tree wood; 2) liana wood characteristics differ systematically from tree wood; and 3) microbial decay is higher for liana wood due to its larger vessels and richer nutrients content, and thus have a stronger effect on the wood decay of lianas compared to trees.
